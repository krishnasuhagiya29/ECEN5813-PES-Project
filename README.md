# Low-Power Modes of FRDM KL25Z

The objective of this project has been to learn about the low-power modes supported by FRDM KL25Z board by running experiments and getting findings based on that.  

Following are the two major experiments covered concerning the Low Leakage Stop (LLS) mode:  
- The modification in ‘power mode switch’ MCU-SDK application to make system transition from RUN mode to the Low Leakage Stop (LSS) mode using Touch Sensor Input (TSI).
- How to build and run the TSS library released by the NXP.
